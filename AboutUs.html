<p> Ms. Stamas- I have been a Physics and Earth/Space science teacher at Sac High for 5 years. This is my second year participating in NASA’s HUNCH program and my first year doing the Design and Prototype challenge. Last year, our Culinary team made Top 10 and we were able to bring our talents to Johnson Space Center. I hope one of my students will one day become a contributor to future space travel back to the moon, to Mars, and beyond.</p>

	<p>Timothy- I am a 16 year old Junior attending Sacramento Charter High School. I am the creator of this website. I’ve learned my coding or computer programming in my summer STEM Program called SMASH at UC Davis. I had signed up for Aerospace Club because I always have a passion for asking questions about things around me. This is my first year of Aerospace Club and what I hope to gain off of it is a better understand about space and how the NASA Mission works. I am overall pretty excited that I am a proud member of Aerospace Club and I can't wait to see what new adventure this club has to offer.  </p></div>
